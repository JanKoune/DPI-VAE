Cases will be defined as individual scripts with the necessary parameters, data and models
assembled in dictionaries. The intention is to standardize the problem definition to make
it easy to switch between test cases for development.

TODO:
    * In the future it might be more convenient to assemble everything in a class that can be derived
        from a `Problem` abstract base class to ensure consistency.
